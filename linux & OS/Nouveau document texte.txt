to grant sudo prvilage to user we have to add it to sudo groups usning the following command :
usermod -aG sudo <user name>
adduser : to add a user
usermod : to modify user
groupadd: to add a group
ls -l   : provide info about file owner and group
chown : change ownership to a new user and new group
chown username:group filename
chgrp   : change the group owner of a file
chmod   : remove or change permission to a fileo or folder
chmod -x <folder/file> "remove execute permission for the folder"
chmod +x <folder/file>  "add execute permission for the folder"
chmod <g/u/o/a><+/-><w/r/x> <folder/file>  "<g/u> g stands for group, u for user, o for other user, a for all users  then <+/-> to specify if we wanna add or remove permission and <w/r/x> to specify the type of permission we wanna add w=write r=read w=execute"
and we can do this to add multiple permissions in one command
chmod g=+rwx <folder/file>
