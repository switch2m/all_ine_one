when we try to reach a website from a host or whatever
it first check the config on the file located at the host in the following path/etc/nsswitch.conf to pick which order its gonna lookup to reach the pod
file content
...
host: files dns
...
here for example its gonna check first on the local host file record: /etc/hosts
if he doesn't find it then i he gonna try to reach out throughout the dns defined on the following path /etc/resolv.conf
example of resolc.conf file
# Use nameservers provided by DHCP
# If DHCP is not used, these lines should be commented out
nameserver 192.168.1.1
nameserver 192.168.1.2

# Use Google's public DNS servers as a fallback
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4

network namespace allows the creation of isolated network environments within a single Linux host. 
Each network namespace has its own network stack, including interfaces, routing tables, firewall rules, and so on
that are independent of other network namespaces
in docker neworking there is three type of docker network:
the none network which is a coompletely isolated network for containers
the host network its a share the network interface with th host
the bridge network This is the default network that is created when you install Docker. It allows containers to communicate with each other 
and with the host system ctainers in the same bridge network can communicate with each other using their hostnames. The network is isolated 
from the host network and other networks by default
if we are using the bridge network to get the ip addr of the container we should run this command:
ip netns to see the net ns useed
and take the output of the command and run the following command:
ip -n <net ns id> addr
or use the docker inspect command

CNI container network interface
