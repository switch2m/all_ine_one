NGINX AS REVERSE PROXY: INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN THE CLIENT AND THE RESSOURCE
http {
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name yourdomain.com;

        location / {
            add_header proxied nginx#to add headers to the client only
            proxy_set_header proxied nginx#to add header to the proxy header server
            proxy_pass http://backend_server_ip:backend_server_port; #generaly where the backend service is deployed but it could be a google.com or any remote server or 
        }
    }
}

for the LOADBALANCER: Distribute request, insure redundency
http {
    upstream backend_servers { 
        server backend_server1_ip:backend_server1_port;
        server backend_server2_ip:backend_server2_port;
        server backend_server3_ip:backend_server3_port;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name loadbalancer.yourdomain.com;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend_servers; #this should math the upstream name
        }
    }
}

SECURE UR NGINX
to hide ur nginx version add this to the http block: server_tokens off; save and reload
to avoid clickjacking ("UI redress attack" or a "UI redressing attack," is a malicious technique in which an 
attacker tricks a user into clicking on something different from what the user perceives they are clicking on) add this
header to the server responses: add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
to prevent XSS attack use this:
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
