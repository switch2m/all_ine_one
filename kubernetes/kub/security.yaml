tls certificate ensure that the communication between the client and  the webserver is encrypted
fo example when u authentificate to a website, if the website doesn't use TLS certificate then the credenetials could be exposed and accesible
if the hacker was sniffing the traffic of the request so we should encrypt this communication 
there two type of encryption:
the data is encrypted using a key and sent to the webserver and in order to to decrypt the data  for the webserver, they need  the key to do that, so a copy of it would
be sent to the webserver and this type of encryption is callled symetric encryption and its less secure since it use the same key for encrypt and decrypt the data 
the second type of encryption is called asymetric encryption and it uses two keys, the private and th, public key for encryption and for decryption, if u encrypt the data with 
public key u can only decryted with the private key, ssh protocol uses asymetric encryption, in websites which uses the https the communication is secure throught openssl and tls protocol
the ebserver sent its public key to the user to encrypt the its data and then this data is sent and decrypted using the private key of the webserver related whith the public key already already 
sent.
