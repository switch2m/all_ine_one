Ansible is a tool to automate it tasks(like repetitive tasks, update docker versions on all servers) this could be done in several ways
./execute tasks remotly from ur own machine
./write the whole configurations on a single yaml file
./ reuse same file multiple time as needed
./ more reliable and less likely to make errors
How ansible work
Ansible actualy work with modules
modules are small programms that do the actual job and each moule do a specific task
play: defines which tasks, which hosts, which user
we specify the hosts where the task should run on the hosts file in the ansible inventory list 
Playbook describes: 
- how and in which order
- at what time an where ( on which machines )
- what ( the modules) should  executed
One advantage of ansible in relation with building image with docker using dockerfile is that its allows u to reproduce the app across many env (create the docker container, vagrant container, cloud instance, bare metal) and also manage not only the docker container but also the host machine where the machine is hosted 

HOst key checking ssh
when we ssh two vm the two vms should identifie and authentificate themselves so one must allow the connection and the other must recognize the server as a valid host, for this to happen the server sshing into the target server must add this info(target server info:name,ip,ssh_key and that's done using this command ssh-keyscan -H <ip_addr> >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts) in a file named known_host and the other step is fot the target server where we're sshing to auhtentificate us(and this is done using this command ssh-copy-id <user>@<ip_add> this will add the public key for my local machine to the sshing target server in a file named authorized_keys after this update on the file we are no longer asked to authentificate to connet to the server)

Module is a reusable peace of code

In ansible there is a concept called register that allows to print out the result of an executed command by storing the output of the command in a variable that we named wathever we want and print it out using a module called debug
