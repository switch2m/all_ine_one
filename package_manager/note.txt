packaging = building the code of the application
building the code evolve compiling and compressing the code in one single file
we keep artifact in storage called artifact repository like NEXUS
artifact includes whole code plus dependencies
build tools depends on programming language for java there is MAVEN or GRADLE
To execute a java artifact .jar filr we use the gollowing command
java -jar <name of the jarfile>
npm and yarn are package managers and not build tools they install dependencies but not used for transpiling java code
install webpack dependencies to build a js app
and add it as a params in scripts build attribute in package.json file
